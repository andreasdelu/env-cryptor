# EnvCryptor

EnvCryptor is a lightweight tool designed to help teams securely share environment variables by encrypting and decrypting `.env` files. This ensures that sensitive information can be managed safely across different environments.

## Features

üîí **Encrypt**: Securely encrypt environment variable files.<br>
üîì **Decrypt**: Decrypt environment variable files back to plaintext.<br>
üñãÔ∏è **Edit**: Edit encrypted environment variable files securely.<br>
üîë **Generate Key**: Generate new encryption keys for secure operations.<br>
üí® **Run**: Execute commands with environment variables decrypted on-the-fly.<br>
ü™∂ **Lightweight**: Minimal dependencies and easy to integrate into any project.<br>

## Installation

You can install the package using `npm`:

```bash
npm install envcryptor
```

Or install it globally:

```bash
npm install -g envcryptor
```

## Usage

### Encrypt

Encrypt an environment variable file using an encryption key:

Using a key as a string:

```bash
npx envcryptor encrypt <input> <output> -s <encryption_key>
```

Using a key from a `.key` file:

```bash
npx envcryptor encrypt <input> <output> -f <key_file>
```

**Options:**

- `<input>`: Path to the input `.env` file.
- `<output>`: Path to the output encrypted file.
- `-s <encryption_key>`: Encryption key as a string.
- `-f <key_file>`: Path to the encryption key file.

### Decrypt

Decrypt an encrypted environment variable file:

Using a key as a string:

```bash
npx envcryptor decrypt <input> <output> -s <encryption_key>
```

Using a key from a `.key` file:

```bash
npx envcryptor decrypt <input> <output> -f <key_file>
```

**Options:**

- `<input>`: Path to the input encrypted file.
- `<output>`: Path to the output decrypted `.env` file.
- `-s <encryption_key>`: Encryption key as a string.
- `-f <key_file>`: Path to the encryption key file.

### Edit

Edit an encrypted environment variable file:

Using a key as a string:

```bash
npx envcryptor edit <file> -s <encryption_key>
```

Using a key from a `.key` file:

```bash
npx envcryptor edit <file> -f <key_file>
```

**Options:**

- `<file>`: Path to the encrypted `.env` file.
- `-s <encryption_key>`: Encryption key as a string.
- `-f <key_file>`: Path to the encryption key file.

### Generate Key

Generate a new encryption key and either save it to a file or output it to the console:

To save to a `.key` file:

```bash
npx envcryptor keygen -o <output>
```

To output to the console:

```bash
npx envcryptor keygen
```

**Options:**

- `-o <output>`: Path to the output `.key` file.

### Run

Run a command with decrypted environment variables:

Using a key as a string:

```bash
npx envcryptor run <file> -s <encryption_key> -- <command>
```

Using a key from a `.key` file:

```bash
npx envcryptor run <file> -f <key_file> -- <command>
```

**Options:**

- `<file>`: Path to the encrypted `.env` file.
- `-f <key_file>`: Path to the encryption key file.
- `-s <encryption_key>`: Encryption key as a string.
- `<command>`: Command to run with decrypted environment variables.

## Examples

### Encrypt an environment variable file:

```bash
npx envcryptor encrypt .env .env.enc -s my_secret_key
```

### Decrypt an encrypted environment variable file:

```bash
npx envcryptor decrypt .env.enc .env -s my_secret_key
```

### Edit an encrypted environment variable file:

```bash
npx envcryptor edit .env.enc -s my_secret_key
```

### Generate a new encryption key:

```bash
npx envcryptor keygen -o .env.key
```

### Run a command with decrypted environment variables:

```bash
npx envcryptor run .env.enc -f .env.key -- node index.js
```

### Load Environment Variables

You can also load environment variables from an encrypted file directly into your application using the `loadEnv` function:

```javascript
import loadEnv from "envcryptor/loadEnv";

loadEnv({
	path: ".env.enc",
	key: "path/to/your/key.key",
});

// Your environment variables are now loaded into process.env
console.log(process.env.YOUR_VARIABLE);
```
